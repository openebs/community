### A brief description of the use case or details on how OpenEBS is helping your projects.
Practicing day 2 management of a vanilla Kubernetes cluster on bare metal.  The whole purpose is to build empathy for practioners such as system administrators and DevOps teams who need to keep clusters running. 

The systems run in the cluster serve as [MacGuffins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin) to keep the cluster healthy and suppress the urge to delete the whole thing and start fresh.
