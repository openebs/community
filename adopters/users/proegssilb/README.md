**Engine:** cStor, might be adding Local PV

**Applications:** PostgreSQL, Redis, Factorio (video game server)

**Future Applications:** NAS, Domain Controller, MinIO, and possibly more.

**Stability:** One Cluster To Rule Them All! (Dev/Prod hybrid, homelab)

**Environment Kind:** Homelab!

OpenEBS is making it easy for me to put storage and compute on the same cheap hardware, and make that storage available to whatever workload might need it. When the lab is done, I expect the cluster to be fairly dense with functionality. Workloads vary between latency-sensitive databases and simple slow-but-reliable file storage.
