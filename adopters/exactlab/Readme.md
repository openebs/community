### A brief description of the use case or details on how OpenEBS is helping your projects.
We are currently using openebs as persistent storage in every deployment where we couldn't have a CEPH cluster and sometimes in hardware that's not state-of-the-art. It comes as a fruitful solution for medium and small workloads, but we're planning to use it in bigger workloads in the future for our customers.
