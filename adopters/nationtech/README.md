### **A brief description of the use case or details on how OpenEBS is helping your projects.**
Very easy to set up and get to a production grade setup with proper automation, dashboards and alerts. Best thing about it I think is the transparency. There is nothing about openebs/zfs-localpv that feels like a black box and it's something important for us when we are considering deploying a storage solution.
